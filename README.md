# *AoC2021*: My Advent of Code 2021 Solutions

[![Public license](https://img.shields.io/badge/MIT_(Expat)-yellow?logo=spdx&logoColor=white)](./LICENSE)
[![Programming Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/Julia_Language-red?logo=julia&logoColor=white)](https://julialang.org/)

My Julia solutions to [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/)
(also known as *AoC2021*) in this most bright time of the year.

When working on my solutions, I aim to make them as universal as possible, that
is, they could be used to solve similar problems, with a bit of
tweaking.  Elegance, readability, and efficiency, in this order, are also my
concerns, though secondary after generality.

## Usage

For each day *N* use either

* `julia src/day`*`N`*`.jl inputs/day`*`N`*`.txt`, or

* `chmod +x src/day`*`N`*`.jl`;

  `src/./day`*`N`*`.jl inputs/day`*`N`*`.txt`.
